            Wirecard AG is an insolvent German payment processor and financial
            services provider at the center of a financial scandal in Germany. The
            company offers its customers electronic payment transaction services and
            risk management, as well as the issuing and processing of physical
            cards. In June 2020, the company's auditor, Ernst & Young found
            discrepancies during their work, which subsequently revealed €1.9
            billion in cash missing.CEO Markus Braun resigned and was arrested. On
            June 25, 2020, Wirecard filed for insolvency and Michael Jaffé was
            confirmed as insolvency administrator. In June 2020 a warrant was issued
            for the arrest of Wirecard's former Chief Operating Officer, Jan
            Marsalek. As of July 1, 2020 the company was expected to be dismantled
            by selling off subsidiaries within a few weeks before they lose their
            remaining value and potential buyers expressed interest in buying parts
            of Wirecard.

            Hedge fund kingpin Ray Dalio is seeing a case for gold as central banks get more aggressive with policies that devalue currencies and are about to cause a “paradigm shift” in investing.
            Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, wrote in a LinkedIn post that investors have been pushed into stocks and other assets that have equity-like returns. As a result, too many people are holding these types of securities and likely to face diminishing returns.
            “I think these are unlikely to be good real returning investments and that those that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold,” the Bridgewater Associates leader said.
            “Additionally, for reasons I will explain in the near future, most investors are underweighted in such assets, meaning that if they just wanted to have a better balanced portfolio to reduce risk, they would have more of this sort of asset. For this reason, I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one’s portfolio. I will soon send out an explanation of why I believe that gold is an effective portfolio diversifier.”
            indian households usually like buying physical gold, but that is expensive and eats into your investment returns as there are making charges and gst associated with it, rather you can invest in etfs that track gold price and achive easier selling and storage of gold.
